## 4.0.0 - 2021-04-16

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed CLI, see: https://github.com/digitalbazaar/cborld-cli

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Use `cborg` as the underlying CBOR library.
- **BREAKING**: Assign term IDs for defined terms in pairs using even numbers
  for terms with single values and odd numbers for multiple values. This
  approach avoids adding additional tags for multiple values and is based
  on the fact that JSON-LD keywords themselves will be assigned term IDs that
  exceed the CBOR single byte value limit of 24. Custom term IDs therefore
  start at 100 and will use two bytes per term up to `65536-100` custom
  terms.
- **BREAKING**: Support embedded and scoped contexts in JSON-LD and, more
  generally, any JSON-LD document that has all of its terms defined. The
  only exceptions are contexts that use change the `@propagate` setting
  from its default; these are not presently supported but may be in a future
  version.
- **BREAKING**: Treat the last 8-bits of the CBOR-LD tag as a compression
  mode with support for mode=0 (no compression) or mode=1 (compression as
  implemented with the above term ID rules, sorting, etc. -- to be updated
  in the spec). Future compression modes can be added to support other
  algorithms.
- **BREAKING**: Type encoding depends on `@type` in term definitions and does
  not require a CBOR Map to be used when encoding values. If a value cannot
  be encoded to match the `@type`, it is the encoders job to provide a
  default uncompressed value that is distinguishable from a compressed one. For
  example, a compressed `@type` value for `foo` may use a `Uint8Array` but an
  uncompressed value may use any other major CBOR type.

## 3.1.1 - 2021-03-30

### Fixed
- Update to latest `@digitalbazaar/cbor` version that has the `ignoreBOM` fix.

## 3.1.0 - 2021-03-29
### Added
- Add entry for X25519 2020 crypto suite context codec.

## 3.0.0 - 2021-03-24

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Use `@digitalbazaar/cbor` as a temporary measure to get better
  Web/browser compatiblity for cbor-ld. The plan is to switch to `cborg`
  library in another subsequent major release.
- **BREAKING**: Temporarily disable `diagnose` mode. This will be re-enabled
  in some way once the transition to the `cborg` library is complete.
- **BREAKING**: Disabled errors that throw when using an app context map with
  tag numbers from the registry. This is currently allowed to enable people
  to use the library even when a new version hasn't been released that supports
  newly registered tags. We'll explore if this is right path forward or if
  we need to do something else in the future.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed support for node 10.x. Node 10.x reaches EOL at
  the end of April 2021 (a little over 30 days from the time this entry was
  written) and it is lacking in features required to run `@digitalbazaar/cbor`. Support
  is therefore being removed.

## 2.2.0 - 2021-03-22

### Added
- Add support for compressing `xsd:date` types.

## 2.1.0 - 2021-02-20

### Changed
- Use `match-all` for compatibility with Node.js <12.
- **NOTE**: The required Node.js version may be increased to v12 sometime after
  v10 hits end-of-life. The above `match-all` support may be removed at that
  time.

## Fixed
- UrlCodec decode dropped base58 multibase prefix.

## 2.0.1 - 2020-10-21

### Fixed
- Get entries based on cborMap type.

## 2.0.0 - 2020-08-18

### Fixed
- Handle decoding of encoded empty object.
- Refactoring to allow simple karma tests to pass.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Move documentLoader towards alignment with JSON-LD spec. Allows
  reuse of jsonld.js document loaders.

## 1.0.0 - 2020-07-23

### Note
- Browser support unfinished in this release.

### Added
